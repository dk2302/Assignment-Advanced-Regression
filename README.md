# Assignment-Advanced-Regression
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## Model Objective:

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house
How well do those variables describe the price of a house?
Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

## Conclusions
Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house:

LotFrontage : If the house Linear feet of street connected to property area increase then the Price increase.

BsmtFullBath : : If the BsmtFullBath area is more the SalePrice is higher

Overall Condition: If the Overall Condition is Excellent the SalePrice is higher

MSZoning_RH : If the house i near residential area then the SalePrice is higher

Overall quality: If the Overall Condition is Excellent the SalePrice is higher

Exterior1st_CBlock : IF the house Exterior1st is CBlock then price is less.

Garage Area: If the Garage area is high the SalePrice is higher

CentralAir: If the CentralAir is Yes the SalePrice is higher

How well those variables describe the price of a house.

These varibles tells about the linear relation with respect the price by which the company can improve ther sales. For instance they can concentrate in invseting properties wich may have high SalePrice in future
